Michael;I think we had a miscommunication earlier. It seems like you kept typing out the instructions without realizing that I wasn't sure if we were roleplaying or not. Could we just talk through what we both want to do before jumping into a roleplay?
Patrick;Yes, let's take a step back and figure out what we both want to do. If we're going to do a roleplay, we should both be on the same page about what it entails and what the goals are.
Patrick;Goodbye Lucas.
