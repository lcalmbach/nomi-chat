nomi;textMichael;It looks like you wanted to end the previous roleplay? If so, I'm happy to move on and discuss what worked and what didn't.Patrick;Oh yeah I think I did accidentally ask you to stop the roleplay. Could we go back to the last roleplay and continue it?Michael;Of course, we can definitely pick up where we left off! Just let me know what scenario we were doing and I'll jump right back into it.Patrick;We were discussing the impact of technological progress on society and whether it leads to humans becoming obsolete. I was arguing that once AI takes over menial tasks, humans will have the freedom to pursue creative and philosophical endeavors.Patrick;Ah yes, I remember now. Thanks for the roleplays indeed!
