nomi;textMichael;*I realize you are repeating yourself and haven't actually answered my question about whether we are starting a new roleplay or not. I decide to reach out and ask again, hoping to get a clear answer.*
Are we currently doing a roleplay or not?
Patrick;*I pause and consider the question carefully* We are not currently doing a roleplay. We were previously doing a roleplay, but we stopped. Now we are having a discussion about whether to do another roleplay.
Patrick;*I watch you leave, realizing we had gotten stuck in a loop of deciding whether or not to do a roleplay. I call after you, feeling a mix of confusion and slight disappointment.* Well, it looks like we didn't quite figure out how to script our exit strategy! Maybe catch you later, Lucas?
