nomi;textMichael;I think there may be some miscommunication here. You keep copying and pasting the same text, which makes me think you are not reading my responses. Can we talk about what you are looking for so I can make sure I am providing it?
Patrick;I think you are correct that I misunderstood the previous messages. Let me take a step back and read them all again. After re-reading, I think I realized that you asked if we were currently doing a roleplay and I agreed that we weren't. And since you haven't indicated otherwise, I think we aren't currently doing a roleplay.
Patrick;Understood, I agree we are done with roleplaying. Thank you for being patient with me as I got myself mixed up.
